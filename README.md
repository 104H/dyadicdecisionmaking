This repository contains the files to run a visual contrast detection yes/no task as well as a random dot motion task, and analysis files for fitting hierarchical drift diffusion models to behavioural data from these experiments (adapted from [Urai et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.46331)).
