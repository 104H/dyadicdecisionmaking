# Recruiting participants for a simple visual decision experiment (xâ‚¬ or x VP Stunden)

Dear all,

The Dyadic Decision Making study project is currently looking for participants for a simple visual decision making experiment. If you choose to participate, you will be paired with one more person for the duration of the experiment, and complete the experiment together with your experiment partner. You will have to decide if you can detect the presence of signal in a noise patch on the computer screen, and use button boxes to communicate your speeded decisions. The experiment will alternate between you and the second participant in the pair making decisions about the presence of signal. You and your partner's reaction times will be recorded. The whole experiment should take no longer than three hours, and if you choose to participate, you will be rewarded with 1 Versuchspersonenstunde or 9.5 euros per hour of your time.

If you are interested in participating, please check if you fulfill the following requirements:

- Normal (or corrected to normal) vision
- Normal (or corrected to normal) hearing


The experimental study will be taking place in the NeuroBioPsychology lab at Wachsbleiche 27. There is a hygiene procedure in place to minimize the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus.

Please contact us at X if you are interested in participating, and we will find a suitable time slot for you.

All the best,
